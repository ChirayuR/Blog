A Mechanical engineer, who likes to solve problems. 

I'm an Undergrad at MNIT Jaipur, pursuing Mech engg. with side courses to dive into robotics. Taken part in several hackathons, challenges & events to keep grooving - "Always need a project to keep me going". 

It was fascinating watching things move, like cars, or a packing machine in Mega-factories on Nat-Geo[^fn-mega]. Well that along with the idea to help people around me, I believe that we could use robotics as a tool to solve problems. Small or big is a question for later.

Apart from my serious introduction, 

I'm a F1-fanatic, mainly because of the regualtions and innovations the teams have done along the years, also Seb <3. I also play F1 (on PC) helps me get to a level of focus where I can work uninterupted, in lockdown I may or may not have played rocket league too much.

Do a little climbing, long distance running, cycling, badminton, reading[^fn-read], a bit of tech-stuff[^fn-tech] & music! 

I was into singing for a while in school, did a bunch of choirs[^fn-choir] and solo vocals, now I'm an enthusiastic bathroom singer. My taste is inclined towards Indie & jazz, big fan of Local Train tho 
(hmu for spotify recommendations).

[^fn-read]: non-fiction mostly.
[^fn-tech]: not flashy, but I built a wireless split keyboard (sofle) <sub> and quadcopters...
