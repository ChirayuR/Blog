A Mechanical engineer, who likes to solve problems. 

Got into robotics by the fascination of watching things move, like cars, or a packing machine in Mega-factories on Nat-Geo[^fn-mega]. Well that along with the idea to help people around me, I believe that we could use robotics as a tool to solve problems. Small or big is a question for later.

Apart from my serious introduction, 
I'm a F1-fanatic, mainly because of the regualtions and innovations the teams have done along the years, also Seb <3.
Do a little climbing, long distance running, cycling, badminton, reading[^fn-read], a techy[^fn-tech] & music! 
I was into singing for a while in school, did a bunch of choirs[^fn-choir] and solo vocals. Now I'm an enthusiastic bathroom singer. My taste is inclined towards Indie & jazz a little more (HMU for spotify recommendations).
