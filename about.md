A Mechanical engineer, who likes to solve problems. 

I have done my engineering from MNIT Jaipur, with a special interest in robotics. Taken part in several hackathons, challenges & events to keep grooving - "Always need a project to keep me going". 

It was fascinating watching things move, like cars, or a packing machine in Mega-factories on Nat-Geo[^fn-mega]. Well that along with the idea to help people around me, I believe that we could use robotics as a tool to solve problems. Small or big is a question for later.

If you are here professionally, my resume is attached [here](https://chirayur.github.io/resume/).


Apart from my serious introduction, 

I'm a F1-fanatic, mainly because of the regualtions and innovations the teams have done along the years, also Seb <3. Better than average [karting driver](https://www.instagram.com/cahair_fpv/), I also drive F1 cars (on PC <sup>hah!</sup>). Driving helps me get to a level of focus and calmness and in lockdown I may or may not have played rocket league too much[^fn-RL].

Do a little climbing, long distance running, cycling, badminton, reading[^fn-read], a bit of tech-stuff[^fn-tech] & music! 

I was into singing for a while in school, did a bunch of choirs[^fn-choir] and solo vocals, now I'm an enthusiastic bathroom singer. My taste is inclined towards Indie & jazz, big fan of Local Train tho 
(hmu for spotify recommendations).
