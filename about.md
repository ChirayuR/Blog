A Mechanical engineer, who likes to solve problems. 

I'm an Undergrad at MNIT Jaipur, pursuing Mech engg. with side courses to dive into robotics. Taken part in several hackathons, challenges & events to keep grooving - "Always need a project to keep me going". 

It was fascinating watching things move, like cars, or a packing machine in Mega-factories on Nat-Geo[^fn-mega]. Well that along with the idea to help people around me, I believe that we could use robotics as a tool to solve problems. Small or big is a question for later.

Apart from my serious introduction, 

I'm a F1-fanatic, mainly because of the regualtions and innovations the teams have done along the years, also Seb <3.
Do a little climbing, long distance running, cycling, badminton, reading[^fn-read], a techy[^fn-tech] & music! 
I was into singing for a while in school, did a bunch of choirs[^fn-choir] and solo vocals. Now I'm an enthusiastic bathroom singer. My taste is inclined towards Indie & jazz, big fan of Local Train tho 
(hmu for spotify recommendations).

[^fn-mega]: [Mega-Factories](https://www.natgeotv.com/in/mega-factories) is a series on Nat-Geo that documents manufacturing of well known products across the world.
[^fn-read]: non-fiction mostly.
[^fn-tech]: not flashy, but the budget oriented Android/Linux. I built a wireless split keyboard (sofle) tho.
[^fn-choir]: was a part of choir at the Indian Embassy of Kuwait for Independance and Republic day celebrations.
