**Release**!
{: .message }

Firstly, hello to myself from 2 years back[^fn-hah].

Wanted to make one for a while, Long-time coming this has been[^fn-yoda].

Lockdown boredom kinda gave me the idea of building a blog-site for myself, and [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) has been a big push and inspiration for me which also helped reinforce the idea to do this[^fn-love].

So I ask you permission to let me blabber all the thoughts in my head in whatever form they maybe[^fn-comics].
